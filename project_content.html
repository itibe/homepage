            <p>Where's my stuff is a web based personal lending library written in Java using the Spring Platform and the Eclipse IDE.
                This project was written in a group of five members. My contribution to the project
                was to design and write the HTML and CSS, however each person added to the HTML and CSS as each new feature was implemented.
                Additionally, I implemented the lend item function, and I added the ability to upload pictures, which were stored in a database.
                Users can add items which can be lent out to others users for a predetermined amount of time. The web site keeps track of the items
                for each user, items lent out, dates lent out, due dates, and borrower ratings</p>

            <p>The recipe website, which was written using the Jetbrains Webstorm IDE, was my final project for Advanced Javascript.
                The website is preloaded with 3 standard recipes for each user. Users can add their own recipes, display
                all recipes, and adjust servings for each recipe.  The data, by default, is stored in JSON format in LocalStorage.
                Users can also store the recipes on a remove server. When storing on a remove server, the data is send in JSON format
                to an API which stores the data in a database. The recipes can be retrieved from the database using another API.
