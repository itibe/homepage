            <p>Where's my stuff is a web based personal lending library written in Java using the Spring Platform and the Eclipse IDE.
                This project was written in a group of five members. My contribution to the project
                was to design and write the HTML and CSS, however each person added too the HTML and CSS as each new feature was implemented.
                Additionally, I implemented the lend item function, and I added the ability to upload pictures, which were stored in a database.
                Users can add items which can be lent out to others users for a predetermined amount of time. The web site keeps track of the items
                for each user, items lent out, lend dates, due dates, and borrower ratings</p>
